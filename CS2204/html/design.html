    <fieldset id="theme">
        <legend>Theme:</legend>
        Mainly use cold tonal colors. The background is a view of the sea,
        which correspond to the users' feeling of relax on their vacation.
        <br>
        The font type is also informal (cursive) to relax users.
        <br>
        The layout of the webpage is mainly developed by frameset tags.
        The values are set in a relative way (use percentage).
    </fieldset>
    <fieldset id="banner">
        <legend>Banner:</legend>
        Use the modular style. The components of the banners are buttons
        that link to these several pages.<br>
        Using the hover design to make some change on these buttons "on_mouse_over" and "gradient"
    </fieldset>
    <fieldset id="p1">
        <legend>Page 1 (search.html):</legend>
        The video will play automatically.
        "Find a hotel", "Things to do" are two large blocks, in which
        smaller blocks are used ("Skiing","Diving")
        The calendar is developed by table.
        The information input is within the frame
    </fieldset>
    <fieldset id="p2">
        <legend>Page 2 (hotel.html):</legend>
        The "Search" part is roughly the same as it is in the first page, except that
        it is used more like a navigation.<br>
        The right hind side is 3 independent blocks about 3 hotels.
        Source of the pictures are <a href="../img/img_source.txt">here</a>
    </fieldset>
    <fieldset id="p3">
        <legend>Page 3 (room.html):</legend>
        <b>Here we automatically assume that the first (Recommended) hotel is selected.</b><br>
        Those input columns are in the same "form" tag.<br>
        A horizontal line "hr" is used to devided the page into two parts.<br>
        The lower part is also made up with 4 blocks.<br>
        <b>The "Book" button are in the forms. Type: submit</b>
    </fieldset>
    <fieldset id="p4">
        <legend>Page 4 (confirm.html):</legend>
        As the booking information cannot be handled without the use of Java Script, I randomly writhe some information there.<br>
        The confirm button is also in a form, action="search.html"(default page)<br>
        Below which a link "here" is pointed back to the room page for making new changes.
    </fieldset>
    <fieldset id="footer">
        <legend>Footer:</legend>
        A logo is also used.<br>
        the "here" link also contains the hover attribute.
